Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project aims to provide insights and analysis into the famous Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects of the passengers and their survival outcomes.

## Overview

The Titanic EDA project focuses on examining the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing passenger survival.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Investigate the structure and features of the Titanic dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset.
- **Visualizations:** Create visual representations (plots, charts) to highlight patterns and trends in the data.
- **Survival Analysis:** Explore factors influencing passenger survival rates.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic-EDA.git
   cd Titanic-EDA
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Explore the Notebooks:**
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to interactively explore and run the analyses.


## Usage Examples

- Investigate passenger demographics.
- Analyze the distribution of ticket classes.
- Explore the correlation between survival and other variables.

## Feedback and Contributions

We encourage feedback, suggestions, and contributions to enhance the Titanic EDA project. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out to us with your insights.

## Credits

- Kaggle for providing the Titanic dataset.
